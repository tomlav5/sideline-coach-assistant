# Pull Request: Enhanced Match Squad & Substitution Management

## 🎯 Overview

This PR delivers three major UX improvements to the live match tracker, solving critical workflow issues and dramatically improving the substitution experience. Users can now add forgotten players mid-match, see all available substitutes at a glance, and make substitutions faster with an intuitive auto-populated dialog.

---

## ✨ Three Major Features

### **1. Edit Squad During Match** 🎯
Add forgotten players to the squad after match tracking has started. Players are added as substitutes and can immediately be brought on field.

### **2. Substitutes Bench Visibility** 👀
Always-visible collapsible section showing all bench players with jersey numbers. Click any substitute to initiate substitution.

### **3. Auto-Populate Substitution Dialog** ⚡
Click a substitute from the bench → dialog opens with that player pre-selected. Reordered fields for faster workflow (Player IN before Player OFF).

---

## 🔴 Problem Statement

**User Report:**
> "Last weekend, I mistakenly only selected 7 out of the available 8 players and started tracking the match. I couldn't then add the 8th player manually."

**Current Limitation:**
- Squad selection is locked once match tracking begins
- Player list is loaded from `fixtures.selected_squad_data` at match start
- No UI to modify squad after match is in progress
- Forgotten players cannot participate or be tracked

**Impact:**
- Manual workarounds required (restart match, edit database)
- Incomplete match statistics
- Poor user experience
- Lost playing time data for forgotten players

---

## ✨ Solution: Edit Squad During Match

### **Option Selected: Edit Squad Button with Modal Dialog**

After analyzing 4 different approaches (documented in `ADD_PLAYERS_DURING_MATCH_OPTIONS.md`), we implemented the most robust solution:

**Key Features:**
- "Edit Squad" button in match tracker
- Modal dialog showing available team players
- Search functionality (by name or jersey number)
- Multi-select capability
- Real-time squad data update
- Automatic player status synchronization
- Preserves data integrity (add-only, no removal)

   - Multi-select with checkboxes
   - Loading and error states
   - Database updates and sync

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **1. EditSquadDialog Component**

**Functionality:**
```typescript
interface EditSquadDialogProps {
  open: boolean;
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void;
  fixtureId: string;
  teamId: string;
  currentSquadPlayerIds: string[];
  onSquadUpdated: () => void;
}
```

**Features:**
- Fetches all team players from `team_players` table
- Filters out players already in squad
- Search by name or jersey number
- Multi-select with visual feedback
- Updates `fixtures.selected_squad_data` JSON field
- Creates `player_match_status` records for new players
- Shows selection summary

### **2. Database Updates**

**Tables Modified:**
```sql
-- fixtures table
UPDATE fixtures 
SET selected_squad_data = {
  ...existing_data,
  selectedPlayerIds: [...existing, ...new_player_ids],
  substitutes: [...existing_subs, ...new_players],
  lastUpdated: timestamp
}
WHERE id = fixture_id;

-- player_match_status table
INSERT INTO player_match_status (fixture_id, player_id, is_on_field)
VALUES (fixture_id, new_player_id, false)
ON CONFLICT (fixture_id, player_id) DO NOTHING;
```

**Data Integrity:**
- New players added to `substitutes` array
- Added with `is_on_field = false` (on bench)
- Can be substituted on using normal substitution flow
- Preserves existing squad structure
- Maintains audit trail via `lastUpdated` timestamp

### **3. UI Integration**

**Button Placement:**
```jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 gap-3">
  <Button onClick={() => setEditSquadOpen(true)} variant="outline">
    <UserPlus className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
    Edit Squad
  </Button>
  {/* Other tertiary actions */}
</div>
```

**Match Locking:**
- Respects active tracker permissions
- Disabled when not the active tracker
- Consistent with other match modification actions

- ✅ Substituted player onto field
- ✅ Playing time tracked correctly

**Scenario 2: Add Multiple Players**

## 🛡️ Data Integrity & Safety

### **Safeguards:**
- **Add-Only Design** - Cannot remove players (prevents breaking events/time logs)
- **Substitute Default** - New players added to bench (safe state)
- **Status Sync** - `player_match_status` automatically created
- **Audit Trail** - `lastUpdated` timestamp in squad data
- **Conflict Handling** - Upsert prevents duplicate status records
- **Transaction Safety** - Database errors don't leave partial state

### **What Can't Be Done:**
- ❌ Remove players already in squad
- ❌ Modify starters during match
- ❌ Delete player data
- ❌ Edit when not active tracker

### **Preserved Data:**
- ✅ Existing match events (goals, assists)
- ✅ Player time logs
- ✅ Substitution history
- ✅ Match periods and scores
- ✅ Original starter designations

---

## 🎯 Use Cases Solved

1. **Forgotten Player** (Primary)
   - Selected 7 of 8 players
   - Can add 8th player mid-match

2. **Late Arrival**
   - Player arrives after match started
   - Can be added to squad on arrival

3. **Multiple Absences**
   - Multiple players not selected initially
   - Can add several at once

4. **Squad Review**
   - Verify all available players included
   - See who's not yet in squad

---

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### **No Database Migration Required**
- Uses existing `fixtures.selected_squad_data` JSON field
- Uses existing `player_match_status` table
- No schema changes needed

### **Backwards Compatible**
- Old squad data format still works
- Graceful handling of missing fields
- No breaking changes

### **Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] Verify squad data updates correctly
- [ ] Check player status sync
- [ ] Test substitution flow with added players
- [ ] Verify match report includes added players
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
